# Simple Chat - an extremely simple command-line interface to OpenAI chat.

This program is really just for myself playing around with OpenAI, but feel free to use it.
It basically just provides an interactive OpenAI chat.

To run it, do the following:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=yourkeyhere ./simplechat.rb
```

Put in `--help` to see the options.
